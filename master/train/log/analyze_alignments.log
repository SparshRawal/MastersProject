The optional-silence phone sil occupies 34.9% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 18.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 493.5 hours of data, or 321.3 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,17.2,53)
