The optional-silence phone sil occupies 34.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 79.5% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence sil occupies 17.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 59.5 hours of data, or 39.2 hours if sil frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences sil comprise 5.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (11,16.4,51)
